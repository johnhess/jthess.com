        <p>At various times, I'm a data scientist, policy wonk, entrepreneur, consultant, software engineer, and aerospace engineer.  I've worked in education, healthcare, flight test, commodities trading, market research, amongst other domains.  This has fairly been characterized as "scattered".  I prefer to characterize it as being a "mad scientist" (the good kind of mad).</p>
        
        <p>Less professionally, I love skiing, riding bikes (both pedal and motor), and hanging out my awesome dog, Bear.  When stuck inside, I read an indefensibly large amount of blogs and news.  I admit I find a lot of it on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. I try not to admit how much of it I find on reddit.  When I'm feeling more sophisticated, I <em>really</em> like to read great long form stuff.  The Sidney Awards are my secret stash.</p>

        <p>I love to learn, and I love to teach.  At the moment, I'm on a self-imposed sabattical.  I'm consulting part-time and taking time to deliberately learn some things I wouldn't have had the chance to pick up in an ordinary workplace (e.g. penetration testing and a cryptocurrency called ethereum).  In January, I'll be taking part in the Berkman Klein Assembly at Harvard, trying to make a dent in the systematic insecurity plaguing virtually every network and device we rely on.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        <p>I have a creeping fascination with the "wild west" portions of the Internet: privacy technologies, cryptocurrencies, trust, and security research (particuarly at the application level).</p>
        <p>A less "wild" fascination of mine is the (sad) Intellectual Property regime in the United States.</p>
        <p>On a more human note, I like to think about how architecture and design can affect socializing (think less <em>facebook</em> and more <em>urban design</em>).  I like this so much that I spent some time building <a href="https://mavenbot.com">Maven</a>, which helps large groups get to know each other better through small, in-person meals and drinks.</p>
