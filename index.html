        <p>I'm an engineer, product manager, data scientist, and policy wonk. I've worked in education at edX and Google, in healthcare policy studying PTSD as a systems problem, in flight test, and in other domains. This has fairly been characterized as "scattered" but I prefer to characterize it as being a "mad scientist" (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5726481-have-i-gone-mad-i-m-afraid-so-you-re-entirely-bonkers">the good kind of mad</a>).</p>

        <p>My current interests are how we come to trust one another in the online sphere, the influence of the built environment on community, and professional ethics as they relate to design, security, and privacy.</p>

        <p>I love to learn and teach, and most recently learned how to fly a plane you can't see out of, learned how to be an EMT, and taught at Google's Computer Science Summer Institute.  I'm hoping to learn to fly gliders soon and eventually become a flight instructor on the side.  I might also try to pick up mobile development.  I've been in Python land doing data science and webdev for a long time.</p>

        <p>Less professionally, I love skiing, riding bikes (both pedal and motor), and hanging out my awesome dog, Bear.</p>
        
        <p>This website's got a smattering of different stuff I've worked on.  It's rarely totally up to date.  There's a certain "The shoemaker's children have no shoes." irony there.  I don't know what to tell you ;-) </p>
