        <p>I'm an engineer, product manager, data scientist, and policy wonk. I've worked in education at edX and Google, in healthcare policy studying PTSD in the US military as a systems problem, in flight test, and other domains. This has fairly been characterized as "scattered" but I prefer to characterize it as being a "mad scientist" (the good kind of mad).</p>

        <p>My current interests are how we come to trust one another in the online sphere, the influence of the built environment on community, and professional ethics as they relate to design, security, and privacy.</p>

        <p>I love to learn and teach, and most recently learned to fly and taught at Google's Computer Science Summer Institute.</p>

        <p>Less professionally, I love skiing, riding bikes (both pedal and motor), and hanging out my awesome dog, Bear.  When stuck inside, I read an indefensibly large amount of blogs and news.  I admit I find a lot of it on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. I try not to admit how much of it I find on reddit.  When I'm feeling more sophisticated, I <em>really</em> like to read great long form stuff especially from The Browser and the Sidney Awards.</p>
