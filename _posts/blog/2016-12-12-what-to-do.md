How people find what they love to do
====================================

There seems to be an infinite store of material to read to learn how to do a job.  Alas, there’s a lot less about how to decide what to do with yourself in the first place.

The more I do, the more I read, the more I learn from friends, the more I realize how little I know about the world and how many decisions I made without even knowing what I was looking at.  

I realized that I don’t know much at all about how people actually find an occupation they love.  I realized there are thousands of interesting corners of the world -- jobs I didn’t even know existed.  So, I decided to seek out some thoughful people doing interesting things and see what I could learn from their stories.  Stories of what they do, how they have or haven’t found what they love, and how they make those big decisions.
