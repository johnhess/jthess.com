Project Idea: Scoring Clickbait to Improve Journalism
=====================================================

Some disinformation travels by way of sensationalized headlines.  Sometimes it's an Outbrain "You won't believe what happens next" but even reputable outlets stretch the article's claims to a more click-worthy title.

By allowing working journalists to score the clickbaitiness of a headline relative to the article's finding, we can get a sense of which scoops are genuinely interesting and which are viral because they're overstated.

Such a system could expand over time to incorporate more norms than simply honest headlines like well supported conclusions and clear sourcing.

A clear view of which individuals and artifacts are trustworthy could inform both readers and amplification systems -- platforms may not wish to knowingly amplify news reports widely distrusted by peers.  And, within peer groups, an incentive for honest labelling of stories can promote good behavior.
