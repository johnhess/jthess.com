First they came for the Muslims, and I did not speak out -- Because I had no idea.
======================================================================

A surge of pride ran through me when the audience at [last night’s Starr forum](http://cis.mit.edu/events/starr-forum-trump%E2%80%99s-victory-what-does-it-mean-you) cheered my local councilperson’s invocation to protest in the streets the moment a “Muslim Registry” is announced <small>[1]</small>.  I was even prouder some joined the chorus “I’ll be registering, too.”

Even more poignantly, a professor whose parents were imprisoned in camps *in this country* said, “The Japanese American community learned a lesson.  And it’s not just to protect our community.  You don’t let this  happen to *anyone*.” <small>[2]</small>

Amen.

But we just might let it happen, and not for apathy or unwillingness to come out from behind keyboards or any other shortcoming of commitment or vigilance.

We might let it happen behind our backs.  The prospect even more terrifying than a show-up-and-be-recorded registry is that governments and private companies already have all they need to secretly create that registry overnight.

The Internet and the most popular services that run on top of it were never intended to hide who we communicate with, only what we say to them (sometimes).  Sadly, who we communicate with is all you need to build to a registry.

You need a startlingly small amount of that who-talks-to-who information to identify what groups people belong to.  And -- even better if you happen to be targeting a movement -- you get to sweep up the group’s close associates and sympathizers in your dragnet with no extra work required.

Using just data drawn from my own personal email account, you can get this color coded graph of the people and groups I associate with.  You can even see my friends that straddle the boundaries between different groups (you know, the sympathizers).  This didn’t take specialized nation-state software or an intelligence agency or Google’s AI team, just a small amount of straightforward math and seconds of computation on a cheap computer.

Graph theory (think “social network graph”, not “bar chart”) makes it easy to identify who associates with who.  And the fact that we each communicate with thousands of other people, web sites, services, and apps makes it all but impossible to hide.  If even one communication channel or a small fraction of databases are compromised and even if it’s only temporary, you can gather enough information to build a reliable graph on a huge group of people... even the people whose communications weren’t explicity compromised like my friends who appear in the data from *my* e-mail account.

Spurred by

[president-elect](http://www.wsj.com/articles/arab-muslim-registry-used-once-before-1448582339) and his

[people](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/nsa-trump-protect-yourself)
have been recommending a range of measures for self protection for activists, journalists, and targeted groups.  Using a confidential email provider, 2-factor authentication, encrypted communications, Tor, a password manager, and not carrying sensitive information through [protests](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protests-united-states) or border zones is great advice.

But none of those things can protect you or anyone else from the information we've already let slip.  Who you communicate with is out there.  All it takes is the will to run the algorithm and we have a Muslim registry <small>[3]</small>.

It can be comforting to think encryption and cryptography can empower Davids threatened by Goliaths.  Sometimes it can.  But not here.  There are zero ways for *individuals* to defend themselves against a Muslim registry.

The *only* recourse to prevent this dystopian “naughty and nice list” is brave, explicit legislation.  We need to take seriously the long-time warnings of privacy advocates and restrict the ways government can collect and use this information.  Raise holy hell with your congressperson.  Call or write them now.  Here’s what I said:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Senator Warren,

Come together with civil libertarian legislators from all parties and put *explicit* limits on the collection and use of data on American citizens *now*.

Not a single human needs to register to make real the spectre of a “Muslim registry”.  It can be done overnight using only data already recorded.  The government wouldn’t even need to collect the data, it could simply buy it.

Putting explicit limits on data collection may make intelligence gathering and law enforcement marginally more difficult and may make me less safe in the future.  I am not afraid of that, and I want you to champion brave legislation to curtail the government’s capabilities, particularly with respect to:

* Bulk metadata collection
* Purchase of raw data or already-synthesized data
* The monitoring of Internet traffic
* Keeping records of the interpersonal affiliations of individuals not under a specific investigation

I will be closely watching and I vote.  Good luck in this endeavor, and do not hesitate to ask for my suppport on it.

You constituent,

John Hess
