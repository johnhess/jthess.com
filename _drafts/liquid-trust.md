title: Surviving Institutional Failure - Liquid Trust

What the Zombie Apocalypse and Organized Crime Teach Us about the Internet
==========================================================================

Our trust in institutions makes the world go 'round.  It's why we can buy something online from someone we've never met (credit cards).  It's why strangers will hire us to work for them and we'll trust that they'll pay us (legal system).  It's why we can mostly trust in the facts we read (newspapers, wikipedia).

When we don't have those trusted institutions, we fall back on our tribal nature.  We rely on people we already trust, and they rely on those that they trust.  It's not as efficient as a market with trusted institutions, but it works.



Trust after the Zombie Apocalypse
---------------------------------

Post-zombie-apocalypse, survivors need to trust one another to rebuild civilization.

Before the outbreak, our heroine could count on institutions to mediate her dealings with new people.  After the outbreak, treachery abounds.  Humans can't safely transact without armed guards.  They can't advertise their location for fear of being raided.  And groups can't take in new members without risking sabotage or worse.

What's a survivor to do?

She can start by relying on personal trust.  She works with family.  She works with friends she knew from back before it all went bad.  Worst case, she works with those she's stuck with.  And she goes from there.

Organized Crime
---------------

Say you're a drug kingpin.  When you can't count on the law to mediate business dealings, you need to work with people you trust.  So you lean on your kids, brothers, sisters and in-laws.  It's no surprise that organized crime is so often a family affair.

Even if you're a talented and stone-cold Heisenberg, you need your Mike, your Saul and your Jesse or you're lost.

Us
-------------------------------

For thousands of years, humans got to rely on their personal networks when institutions fail them or they decide those institutions need to go.  But falling back on those ties doesn't work like it used to.  Communication is a force multiplier.  The Internet is the defining technology of our age.  Anyone who can use the Internet but denies access to an adversary gains an advantage.

We've seen states deny the full internet to dissidents again and again and again.  I wont comment who I think is right or wrong in any of these cases because that's not the point.  The point is that powerful entities can take away select portions of the Internet by targeting and compromising two centralized institutions at its core: DNS and PKI.

Of course, governments have always had the option of turning the whole thing off.  But that means cutting off commerce, non-dissenting communication, and state media, too.  Not an easy sell, and a good way to alienate the whole population.

VPNs have been a great tool but they're not enough.  More next time on how to decentralize these vulnerable components. (Certificate Transparency).

Examples
--------

Diginotar, DNS in Turkey, Natl Sec cert in Kazakhstan.  A lot of times, it happens at the worst possible moment, right when humans most need communication.
