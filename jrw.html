You've found J. Random Workstation.  Welcome, Sectorian.
<br/><br/>
This is John's stuff.  If it's in your way, go ahead and move it.  If you want to use it, please go ahead!
<br/><br/>
Just try to keep all the cords and stuff (monitor, goofy keyboard, normal mouse, aluminum laptop stand) together.  Thanks!
